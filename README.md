# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles repository. This is a work-in-progress task and it will always be, however it's not ready to be used yet.
Versioning my dotfiles will be useful when I'll need to set up a new workstation without worrying too much about reconfigure things over and over.
Also, versioning my dotfiles allows me to upgrade and improve my setup for applying it everywhere I need, almost effortlessly.

## YADM

YADM is a Git Wrapper for versioning dotfiles and it has several benefits over standard Git cli, which can be checked out in its
own repository. I'm using YADM and it's one of the first things I need to install in order to applying my dotfiles in my machine.
